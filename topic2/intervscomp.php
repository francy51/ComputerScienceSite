        <h2>Compiler</h2>

        <p>Some exmaples of compiled languages are C++ , C, Java. These are only 3 of many different compiled languages. Compiled languages are commonly used by big

        tech firms such as google to create software for users. This is because once compiled the compiler creates Object Code which is run on the machine. This allows the creator to keep

      the source code and not distribute it. Also the Object Code is nearly impossible to reverse engineer so that the source code can be seen. Due to the robust nature of compiled languages

    they are normally used to create base frameworks which other frameworks can be placed on.</p>



    </div>

    <div class="">

      <h2>Interpreter</h2>

      <p>Some examples of interpreted languages are Python, Javascript, Cobol. Interpreted languages are noramlly used by beginner programmers to learn the fundamentals of programming as they

      can easily be debuged since they run line by line. This means that the second an error occurs the program will stop at the exact point in which there is an error. Interpreted languages are

    not commonly used by companies since the product can\'t be distributed without the source code. Normally interpreted languages are used to create plugins for robust frameworks created by

  using compiled languages</p>
