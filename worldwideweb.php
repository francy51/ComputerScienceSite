        <h4>Within the web itself their are many different types of 'web'. There is the <a href="/defenitions.php#SurfaceWeb">surface web</a> which are all the things that
        are searchable on the web. This means that the web page can appear on a search engine. There also is the <a href="/defenitions.php#DeepWeb">deep web</a> which doesn't
          appear onto search enginges and can only be accessed if the url is directly type in. Finally there is the <a href="/defenitions.php#DarkWeb">dark web.</a> To access the dark
          web the user needs more software to increase their anonymyty and privacy such as a tor browser. The idea behind the dark web is that it has an increased amount of anonymity almost to the
          point of being completly anonymouse.
