        <p class="h5">Advance searches are a common feature in all modern search engines (Atleast the ones worth using). What advance searches allow you to do is make more specific and relavent searches appear. This search engines allows you to do this throught many different mathods.
         </p>

         <h3>Syntax</h3>
         <p>One of the most common methods of allowing users to make advance searches is creating special syntax that can be put within the search bar to specify certain things. For example if you write "text score" it will search for the phrase "test score" rather than each word by itself(test and score). Through this method the search engine can allow the user to create semi complex search queries increasing the relavents of their results. </p>

        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <p>Another method used by search engines is filters. Filters simlarly to Syntax requires the user to input key phrases and words but filters also require the user to tell the search engine other requiremnts such as what language, region,license the search results should have.
<br>

          <ul>
            You can filter by :
            <li>Language</li>
            <li>Region</li>
            <li>Last update(when was the last time the site was updated)</li>
            <li>Site or domain(.edu , .gov etc.)</li>
            <li>Terms appearing(anywhere in the page, title , etc.) </li>
            <li>Safe search (filters explicit content)</li>
            <li>File type</li>
            <li>Usage rights(license type)</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Advance searches are crucial to creating relavent and usefull search results of the user. How they are implemented is a long and complicated process which take into consideration many different factors as the relavency of the data could make or brake the platform. </p>
